# /dev-flow — Explore → Architect → Plan → Implement → Test → Review

Orchestrate the following subagents **in order** for the task in
`$ARGUMENTS`. Pass each agent's output forward as context. Stop and report if
any stage raises a blocker.

## Memory layer (agentcohort v0.10+)

1. Before invoking the first subagent, run:

   `RUN_ID=$(agentcohort run start --pipeline=dev-flow --tier=3 --task-summary="<one-line summary of $ARGUMENTS>")`

2. Include `Run ID: $RUN_ID` in EVERY subagent invocation prompt below. Subagents use this UUID to read/write the run scratchpad and tag every memory write.

## Pipeline

1. **repo-scout** — locate files, trace current flow, identify change points.
2. **solution-architect** — *only if the task is architecture-sensitive*
   (touches module boundaries, public API, data model/schema, auth,
   concurrency, caching, or cross-cutting behavior). Otherwise skip and say
   why it was skipped.
3. **🚦 HUMAN GATE — architect** (only if step 2 ran). Read
   `.agentcohort.json` for `gates.architect` (default `on`). If `on`, OR
   `auto` AND the dispatcher classified this as Tier 4 / arch-sensitive,
   STOP and surface the architect's decision (chosen approach + key
   trade-offs + risks).

   ### Approval summary — architect
   **You are approving:** the proposed architecture before the planner turns it into an implementation checklist.
   **Current conclusion:** the architect has chosen an approach and identified the key trade-offs and risks for this task.
   **If approved, Claude will:**
   1. pass this architecture to `feature-planner`
   2. build an implementation checklist, tests, and verification around this approach
   3. stop again at the plan gate before any code is written
   **Not done yet:** no implementation has started; no files or tests have been changed.
   **Decision needed:** should Claude use this architecture as the basis for the implementation plan?

   Then use the **`AskUserQuestion`** tool with:
   - `question`: `"Architect verdict — proceed with this approach?"`
   - `header`: `"Architect gate"`
   - `options`:
     - `Approve` — Continue to the planner with this architecture.
     - `Revise` — I'll provide feedback; re-run the architect.
     - `Abort` — Stop the pipeline.
   On `Approve` continue to step 4. On `Revise` ask the user for the
   feedback as a free-form follow-up, then re-run solution-architect
   with it. On `Abort` stop. If the orchestrator environment lacks
   `AskUserQuestion`, fall back to a numbered text menu and accept
   `1`/`y`/Enter as Approve, `revise <feedback>` as Revise, `abort`
   as Abort. If `gates.architect` is `off`, skip this gate entirely.

   After the user responds to the gate, the orchestrator records the outcome:

   `agentcohort gate record --run-id=$RUN_ID --gate=architect --outcome=<approved|rejected|escalated|auto-skipped> --proposed-content="<short>" --posing-agent=solution-architect [--reason="<user text on reject/escalate>"]`

4. **feature-planner** — produce the bite-sized, test-first implementation
   checklist with exact files and verification.
5. **🚦 HUMAN GATE — plan**. Read `.agentcohort.json` for `gates.plan`
   (default `on`). If `on`, OR `auto` AND Tier ≥ 4, STOP and surface the
   plan (files to touch, tests to add, verification commands).

   ### Approval summary — plan
   **You are approving:** the exact implementation checklist before code changes begin.
   **Current conclusion:** the planner has identified the files to touch, tests to add, and verification commands to run.
   **If approved, Claude will:**
   1. implement exactly this plan
   2. run the planned tests and verification
   3. hand the final diff to `final-reviewer`
   **Not done yet:** code has not been changed yet under this plan.
   **Decision needed:** should Claude implement this exact plan now?

   Then use **`AskUserQuestion`** with:
   - `question`: `"Plan ready — proceed with implementation?"`
   - `header`: `"Plan gate"`
   - `options`:
     - `Approve` — Implement exactly this plan.
     - `Revise` — I'll provide feedback; re-run the planner.
     - `Abort` — Stop the pipeline.
   Same fallback contract as the architect gate
   (`1`/`y`/Enter / `revise <feedback>` / `abort`).

   After the user responds to the gate, the orchestrator records the outcome:

   `agentcohort gate record --run-id=$RUN_ID --gate=plan --outcome=<approved|rejected|escalated|auto-skipped> --proposed-content="<short>" --posing-agent=feature-planner [--reason="<user text on reject/escalate>"]`

6. **feature-implementer** — execute the plan; minimal change; focused tests;
   targeted verification; no scope creep.
7. **test-verifier** — add/run tests, typecheck, lint; fix only breakages
   caused by this change; report real output.
8. **final-reviewer** — review the actual diff: correctness, regression,
   scope creep, security, data consistency, missing tests. Verdict required.

## Rules

- The architect decision (if invoked) is binding on the planner and
  implementer. Implementer must not re-architect.
- No API / schema / auth / security / persistence semantic change unless the
  architect explicitly decided it and the user approved it.
- Prefer the minimal safe change. Unrelated improvements are reported, not done.
- If `final-reviewer` returns BLOCK, summarize the blockers and recommend
  `/fix-blockers` — do not auto-loop silently.

## Output

A stage-by-stage summary, ending with the reviewer's APPROVE/BLOCK verdict and
the concrete next step.

## Pipeline end

The **final-reviewer** (designated last agent for this pipeline) must call:

`agentcohort run end --run-id=$RUN_ID --outcome=success --agents-run=<csv of agents that actually ran> [--gates-fired=<csv of gates that fired>]`

If the pipeline aborted at a gate, the gate-record step already called `run end --outcome=aborted` — do NOT call it again.
